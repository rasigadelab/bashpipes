DNA phylogeny pipeline

OBJECTIVE

To derive DNA-based maximum-likelyhood phylogeny of large replicons (chromosomes and plasmids) using core-genome alignment.

EXAMPLE

cd genomes
mob_recon_gather.sh myplasmid plasmid_AA002
cd myplasmid
make_core_tree.sh

PREREQUISITES/INITIAL STATE

Reconstructed replicon sequences as provided by mob_recon.

Working directory contains a 'sequences' subdir, with isolate-named subdirs each containing the replicon sequence. If an isolate contains several close replicons to be compared, create new isolate subdirs.

wd/sequences/
    isolate1/<replicon>.fasta
    isolate2/<replicon>.fasta
    ...
    samples.txt

Sequences can be extracted from a general genomes repo using the 'plasmid_gather.sh' command,

plasmid_gather.sh <working directory> <replicon>

will create directory <working directory>, then search in the repo for ./*/mob_recon/<replicon>.fasta and populate the working directory.

PACKAGES

prokka, panaroo, iqtree

OVERVIEW

Replicon sequences are annotated using prokka. A core-genome alignment is obtained using panaroo. A fast ML tree is obtained using iqtree with model KHY.

GOING FURTHER

Refine SNP calling by aligning raw reads to the core-genome consensus instead of using assemblies.
